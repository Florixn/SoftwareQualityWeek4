# Software Quality Task 4

This is a Java-based project developed for the fourth Task of the Software Quality course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and practice basic software quality techniques, including version control with Git and Licensing. 

## Project Overview

The project is the one which was used to pass the first weeks Task of the Software Quality course. It includes a simple Java class, `Main.java`, that contains a method called `computeValue`. This method performs basic arithmetic operations based on the values of the input parameters `x` and `y`.

### Purpose
The project doesn't provide any further purpose, as it is mainly used to practice licensing.
Nevertheless, it contains the `computeValue` Method, which can be called using the parameters x and y.

### Prerequisites
- **Current Java Version**: Ensure Java is installed and set up on your machine. Make also sure your version is not outdated. You can download it from [Oracle's Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed for version control. You can download it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Florixn/SoftwareQualityWeek4.git
   cd SoftwareQualityWeek4
2. **Open the project in your preferred IDE.**

3. **Build and Run:** <br>
Compile the Java code and run Main.java.

### Usage
    
    //If you wanna test the the computeValue method, you can do so parameters in Main.java. Adjust x and y values to see how the output changes.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = computeValue(5, 3);
    System.out.println("Computed Value: " + result);  // Expected output based on input values (e.g., for computeValue(5, 3), the output will be 46)
    }
